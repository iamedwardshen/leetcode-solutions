  <h2>Using What You Already Have</h2>
<p class="meta">12 Jun 2014</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Sometimes we keep looking for resources everywhere only to realize that we had
it with us the whole time. Situation like these might arise when you have too
many choices. I too faced these moments before. It is a tough situation indeed.</p>

<p>I think one should develop art of learning before trying to learn a lot of
things at once. Once you know how to learn and improve how to learn through
constant iterations. It becomes easy thereafter.</p>

<p>I changed quite a lot as a developer and person. Last year. I was all about
learning new technologies, getting super aware about all the frameworks that
are popular. Now, I don&#39;t even bother checking these. My goals are now mostly
on low level decisions or high level architecture. All these frameworks and
likes are just tooling. Nothing less nothing more. The main focus should be on
problem solving. And problem solving at its heart is always
Language/Platform/Frameworks agnostic.</p>

<p>Reading books and theory is also very important at this stage. Consider it as
like sitting on the shoulder of giants. Of course practise is very important as
well but making sure there is a good balance between these two really pays off.</p>

<p>I love reading books. I have bought quite some books in the past 11 months. I
have so much to read and learn from these gems. I have done good progress in
completing some of these. Hoping to cover more in the near future.</p>
